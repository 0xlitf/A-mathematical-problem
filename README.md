Q1: 

  A mathematical problem:
  
  x1 x2 ... xn belongs to nonnegative integer (x1 x2 ... xn >= 0)
  
  x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= ... >= xn
  
  x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn = n
  
  
  How many number of solution set meet the above conditions.


Q2: 

  A mathematical problem:
  
  x1 x2 ... xn belongs to positive integer (x1 x2 ... xn >= 1)
  
  x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= ... >= xn
  
  x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn = k
  
  
  How many number of solution set meet the above conditions.
